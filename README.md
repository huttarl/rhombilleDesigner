# rhombilleDesigner
A Godot program to design a rhombille (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombille_tiling) pattern, AKA tumbling blocks, reversible cubes, or the dice lattice.
The goal for the first iteration is that a rhombille grid of cubes is displayed, and the user can click on each cube to toggle its convex/concave state.
We might use this for designing quilts, for example.

Code written with help from Claude.AI.
